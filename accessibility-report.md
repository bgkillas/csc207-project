## **Section 1: Principles of Universal Design**
1. Equitable Use
- To implement: Adding alternative input methods such as voice commands and full keyboard navigation will make the app accessible to users with different physical abilities.

2. Flexibility in Use
- To implement: A voice typing feature could help users who prefer speaking over typing, improving accessibility and convenience.

3. Simple and Intuitive Use
- Features like friend requests and post feeds mirror familiar social media patterns.
- The navigation bar remains consistent across main tabs, making it easy for users to move through the app intuitively.

4. Perceptible Information
- Currently, the app relies on visual cues to convey information.
- To implement: We plan to add captions for any audio content and ensure that color is never the sole indicator of status, helping users with visual impairments.

5. Tolerance for Error
- Some actions could lead to mistakes if done accidentally.
- To implement: Adding confirmation pop-ups for critical actions and an undo option for deletions will help prevent unintended consequences.

6. Low Physical Effort
- Controls use large, well-spaced buttons to minimize effort in navigation and interaction.
- Login requires only one click through existing Spotify authentication, removing the need for typing credentials.

7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
- The app uses a responsive layout with scalable text and adequate spacing to avoid clutter.
- Users can expand screen space and comfortably interact with UI elements without crowding.


## **Section 2: Program Marketing**
We would market our program, S-Buddify, to individuals interested in making new friends, such as those new to a city, university or college students, or participants in orientation programs for various organizations. Our primary target audience would be those who are passionate about music and view it as a shared language that can bridge differences and serve as a powerful connector. While many existing social and dating platforms allow users to connect their Spotify or other music streaming accounts as an optional feature, our program is built around using music as its main matching criterion. By focusing specifically on pairing people with similar tastes in genres, artists, and songs, we aim to create a more meaningful and authentic matching experience. If we were to sell or license our program, we would position it as a niche social networking tool for music enthusiasts seeking authentic connections. S-Buddify would offer a distinctive alternative to generic connection platforms, filling a gap for users who want their music interests to be at the heart of their social interactions.

## **Section 3: Demography and Accessibility of Program Use**
S-Buddify is primarily designed for Spotify users and incorporates features to make it more inclusive across demographics. For example, gender is stored as a free-text string rather than a fixed binary option, allowing users to self-identify in the way that best reflects them. Users can also set preferences for age, gender, and location, and complete their profile to share information in their own words, supporting diversity and personal expression. We do recognize that users without Spotify access, such as very young individuals or those using other streaming platforms like Apple Music, may be less likely to use the program. S-Buddify may also be less accessible for individuals with visual or hearing impairments in its current proof-of-concept without adequate accessibility features implemented. We recognize that designing primarily for the “majority” user, Spotify subscribers without sensory impairments, risks excluding significant minority groups and can cause both tangible harm (loss of access to social opportunities) and relational harm (feeling less equal or valued). In designing the initial build of S-Buddify, we have focused on the majority use case of Spotify users who value music as a social connector, but we would aim to keep expanding the program so that its benefits are accessible to as many people as possible. This is because we recognize that while users outside our primary demographic may represent a smaller share of potential users, they can still form a substantial portion of the market, as seen in cases like Apple vs. Android compatibility. To promote inclusivity, our design would continue to develop by focusing on the principles of universal design, through features like adjustable font sizes, high-contrast UI, and alternative text, which not only support users with disabilities but also improve the experience for all users.
