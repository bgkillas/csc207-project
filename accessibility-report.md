## **Section 1: Principles of Universal Design**
1. Equitable Use
- To implement: Add interaction alternatives (voice, keyboard)
2. Flexibility in Use
- To implement: (not sure what might become customizable to each user)
3. Simple and Intuitive User
- Friend requests and posts are familiar social features. Consistent nav bar persisting along three main tabs.
4. Perceptible Information
- To implement: Captions for audio content, and avoid relying on color alone to indicate status.
5. Tolerance for Error
- To implement: Add confirmation pop-ups for critical actions (e.g., "Are you sure you want to decline this request?"), and an undo feature for actions like deleting a post.
6. Low Physical Effort
- Controls with buttons are large and well-spaced such that low-effort actions are possible.
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
- Screen space is not fixed as is expandable. Responsive layout, scalable text, and adequate spacing that prevents crowding of UI with too many elements.


## **Section 2: Program Marketing**
We would market our program, S-Buddify, to individuals interested in making new friends, such as those new to a city, university or college students, or participants in orientation programs for various organizations. Our primary target audience would be those who are passionate about music and view it as a shared language that can bridge differences and serve as a powerful connector. While many existing social and dating platforms allow users to connect their Spotify or other music streaming accounts as an optional feature, our program is built around using music as its main matching criterion. By focusing specifically on pairing people with similar tastes in genres, artists, and songs, we aim to create a more meaningful and authentic matching experience. If we were to sell or license our program, we would position it as a niche social networking tool for music enthusiasts seeking authentic connections. S-Buddify would offer a distinctive alternative to generic connection platforms, filling a gap for users who want their music interests to be at the heart of their social interactions.

## **Section 3: Demography and Accessibility of Program Use**
S-Buddify is primarily designed for Spotify users and incorporates features to make it more inclusive across demographics. For example, gender is stored as a free-text string rather than a fixed binary option, allowing users to self-identify in the way that best reflects them. Users can also set preferences for age, gender, and location, and complete their profile to share information in their own words, supporting diversity and personal expression. We do recognize that users without Spotify access, such as very young individuals or those using other streaming platforms like Apple Music, may be less likely to use the program. S-Buddify may also be less accessible for individuals with visual or hearing impairments in its current proof-of-concept without adequate accessibility features implemented. We recognize that designing primarily for the “majority” user, Spotify subscribers without sensory impairments, risks excluding significant minority groups and can cause both tangible harm (loss of access to social opportunities) and relational harm (feeling less equal or valued). In designing the initial build of S-Buddify, we have focused on the majority use case of Spotify users who value music as a social connector, but we would aim to keep expanding the program so that its benefits are accessible to as many people as possible. This is because we recognize that while users outside our primary demographic may represent a smaller share of potential users, they can still form a substantial portion of the market, as seen in cases like Apple vs. Android compatibility. To promote inclusivity, our design would continue to develop by focusing on the principles of universal design, through features like adjustable font sizes, high-contrast UI, and alternative text, which not only support users with disabilities but also improve the experience for all users.
