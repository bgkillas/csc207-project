## **Project Summary**

**S-Buddify** is a Java-based social music friend finder platform that connects users based on their musical preferences. The application integrates with Spotify's API to analyze users' listening habits and matches them with others who have similar music tastes.

### **What This Project Does**
S-Buddify provides a comprehensive social platform where users can:
- Connect their Spotify accounts to analyze their music taste
- Set up a unique and personalized profiles with information and a profile picture
- Get matched with other users based on shared musical interests
- Create and share posts about music
- Comment on other users posts
- Build a social network of music enthusiasts
- Filter potential matches based on age, location, and other preferences

### **Why This Project Was Made**
This project was developed to solve the challenge of finding like-minded music enthusiasts in a digital age. Many music lovers struggle to discover new people who share their musical tastes, and traditional social platforms don't focus on music compatibility. S-Buddify bridges this gap by using actual listening data to create meaningful connections.

### **Problem It Solves**
- **Music Discovery**: Helps users find people with similar music tastes
- **Social Connection**: Creates a community of like-minded music enthusiasts
- **Experience Sharing**: Enables users to share and discuss their musical experiences, concerts, and discoveries with friends
- **Data-Driven Matching**: Uses real Spotify listening data instead of self-reported preferences
- **Filtered Experience**: Allows users to set preferences for age, location, and other criteria

## **Features**

### **Spotify Integration**
- **Automatic Profile Creation**: Connects to your Spotify account to automatically populate your music preferences
- **Top Tracks Analysis**: Analyzes your most-listened tracks, genres, and artists to understand your music taste

**Example (programmatic usage & output)**
```java
// Example: fetch Spotify data used for matching (pseudo-usage)
SpotifyInterface spotify = session.getSpotify(); // Get the SpotifyInterface instance from the current user session
spotify.initSpotify(); // Start Spotify authentication process (opens browser for user login)
spotify.pullUserData(); // Retrieve the logged-in Spotify user's ID and display name
spotify.pullTopArtistsAndGenres(); // Retrieve the user's top artists and genres from Spotify
spotify.pullTopTracks(); // Retrieve the user's top tracks from Spotify

System.out.println("User: " + spotify.getUserName() + " (" + spotify.getUserId() + ")");
System.out.println("Top Artists: " + spotify.getTopArtists());
System.out.println("Top Tracks: " + spotify.getTopTracks());
System.out.println("Top Genres: " + spotify.getTopGenres());
```
**Output**
```text
User: Alice (user_12345)
Top Artists: [Taylor Swift, The Weeknd, Coldplay, Joji, Ed Sheeran]
Top Tracks: [Cardigan, Blinding Lights, Yellow, Glimpse of Us, Shivers]
Top Genres: [pop, indie pop, alt-pop, pop, pop rock, indie pop]
```

### **User Matching System**
- **Artist & Genre Matching**: Compares users’ favourite artists and genres
- **Compatibility Scoring**: Computes a numeric score from overlap in artists and genres
- **Filtered Matching**: Set preferred age range, gender, and location for potential matches

**Example (programmatic usage & output)**
```java
// Assume we have a logged-in session
UserSession session = ...;

// Get current user and all registered users
User currentUser = session.getUser();
List<User> allUsers = session.getAllUsers();

// Set the current user's match filter
SetupMatchFilterInteractor setupFilter = new SetupMatchFilterInteractor(
        filter -> System.out.println("Filter saved: " + filter),
        session
);
setupFilter.setupFilter(20, 30, "female", "Toronto");

// Find candidates that pass both users' filters
MatchService matchService = new MatchServiceImpl(); // no-arg constructor
List<User> candidates = matchService.findMatches(currentUser, allUsers);

// Display compatibility scores (calculated separately)
MatchCalculatorImpl calculator = new MatchCalculatorImpl();
System.out.println("=== Match Candidates ===");
for (User u : candidates) {
    int score = calculator.calculateCompatibilityScore(currentUser, u);
    System.out.println(u.getName() + " — " + score + "%");
}
```
**Output**
```text
Filter saved: MatchFilter{minAge=20, maxAge=30, gender='female', location='Toronto'}
=== Match Candidates ===
Diana — 92%
Eric — 87%
Alice — 85%
```

### **Matching Interaction**
- **Profile Browsing** – View profiles of potential matches, including name, age, location, biography, and compatibility score in the matchingroom  
- **Connect or Skip** – Choose to connect with or skip a potential match. Clicking **Connect** sends a friend request to the other user's mailbox. Clicking **Skip** removes the other user from your matching queue
- **Handle Incoming Requests** – Receive friend requests from other users in your mailbox. Click **Accept** to add them to your friend list, or **Decline** to remove them from your matching queue

**Example (programmatic usage & output)**

```java
// Assume we have a logged-in session and a candidate user
UserSession session = ...;
User matchedUser = ...;  // a user from your match candidates

// Connect flow (non‑mutual): sends a friend request to matchedUser
matcher.connect(session, matchedUser);

// Skip flow: removes the user from incoming/outgoing match queues
matcher.skip(session, matchedUser);

// Simulate that 'matchedUser' has already sent a request to 'currentUser'
User currentUser = session.getUser();
matchDataAccessObject.getOutgoingFriendRequest(matchedUser).add(currentUser);

// Now connect — should immediately become friends
matcher.connect(session, matchedUser);
```
**Output**
```text
[Presenter] Friend request sent to Diana
[Presenter] You are now friends with Diana
```
Note: visualization will be shown in the usage session.
